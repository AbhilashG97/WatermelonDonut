# MATLAB Theory

## Variables and Data types

### Data types
MATLAB provides 15 fundamental data types. Every data type stores data that is in the form of a matrix or array. The size of this matrix or array is a minimum of 0-by-0 and this can grow up to a matrix or array of any size.

## Operators

MATLAB allows the following types of elementary operations −

1. Arithmetic Operators
1. Relational Operators
1. Logical Operators
1. Bitwise Operations
1.  Set Operations

MATLAB allows two different types of arithmetic operations −

1. Matrix arithmetic operations
1. Array arithmetic operations

Matrix arithmetic operations are same as defined in linear algebra. Array operations are executed element by element,both on one-dimensional and multidimensional array.

The matrix operators and array operators are differentiated by the period (```.```) symbol.
