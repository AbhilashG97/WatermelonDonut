# Epileptic Seizures Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods

Please read [this](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2017/9074759/) research-paper for more details.

Below mentioned are a few important points - 

1. Preprocessing of EEG signals for noise removal and features extraction are two major issues that have an adverse effect on both anticipation time and true positive prediction rate.

1. They have used Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for preprocessing and have extracted time and frequency domain features for training a prediction model.

1. Epileptic seizures have four different states: the preictal state, which is a state that appears before the seizure begins, the ictal state that begins with the onset of the seizure and ends with an attack, the postictal state that starts after ictal state, and interictal state that starts after the postictal state of 1st seizure and ends before the start of preictal state of consecutive seizure.

1. The purpose of this investigation is to detect the appearance of preictal state for epileptic seizures.
